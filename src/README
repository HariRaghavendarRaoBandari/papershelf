# Description: A simple tool for paper organization

# Motivation: Categorizing academic papers is a difficult but useful job, 
# especially in some areas (i.e. computer science) which have tons of (good)
# papers. A good category helps you (1) track latest problems and techniques;
# and (2) understand related studies of your own research. Existing tools mainly
# focus on (1) tagging the paper with random words, (2) saving into a local or 
# cloud storage, and (3) simply retrieving. There is no summarization, thinking,
# and categorization. The papershelf tool is developed to solve this problem.
# Its key idea is "thinking while recording".
# How does it work? Please try :D
