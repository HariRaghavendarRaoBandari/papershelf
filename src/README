# Description: A simple tool for paper organization
# Developer: Ming Liu

# Motivation: 
# Categorizing academic papers is a difficult but useful job, especially in some
# areas (i.e. computer science) which have tons of (good) papers. A good category
# helps you (1) track latest problems and techniques; and (2) understand related
# studies of your own research. Existing tools mainly focus on (1) tagging the 
# paper with random words/notes, (2) saving into a local or cloud storage, and
# (3) simply retrieving. There is no summarization, thinking, and categorization.
# The papershelf tool is developed to solve this problem. Its key idea is "thinking
# while recording".
# How does it work? Keep reading or try :D

# Papershelf: Design And Implementation
# This tool organizes papers as follows:
#
#                area --> field --> subfield --> problem --> paper
#
# Here are two examples:
# papershelf --> computer science
#                --> Architecture
#                    --> Datacenter
#                        --> Benchmarking
#                            --> 2012, ASPLOS, Clearing the Clouds: A Study of Emerging
#                                              Scale-out Workloads on Modern Hardware
#            --> computer science
#                --> System
#                    --> Energy&Power
#                        --> PowerManagement
#                            --> 2015, SOSP, Software Defined Batteries
#
# The above case presents two transactions:
# 
#     area --> computer science
#     field --> Architecture
#     subfield --> Datacenter
#     problem --> Benchmarking
#     paper --> 2012, ASPLOS, Clearing the Clouds: A Study of Emerging Scale-out 
#               Workloads on Modern Hardware
#
#     area --> computer science
#     field --> System
#     subfield --> Energy&Power
#     problem --> PowerManagement
#     paper --> 2015, SOSP, Software Defined Batteries
