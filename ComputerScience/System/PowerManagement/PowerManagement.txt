soccixcp.pdf|Energy Proportionality and Workload Consolidation for Latency-critical Applications|2015|SOCC|This paper introduces the adaptive, flow-centric scheduling approach to resource scheduling, which is different from the POSIX method. POSIX applications balance flows by migrating file descriptors between threads or prprocesses, but this tends to be inefficient because it is difficult for the kernel to match the flows's destination receive queue to changes in CPU affinity. The flow-centric mmethod allows flows to be migrated in entire groups, improving efficiency, and is compatible with more scalable hardware flow steering mechanisms based on RSS (i.e. receive side scaling).
